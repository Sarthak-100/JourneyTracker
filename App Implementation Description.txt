The app uses a Stop data class to represent each stop along the journey. Each Stop has a name and a distance from the previous stop.

The main screen displays the name of the current stop, buttons to switch between kilometers and miles, and a button to indicate reaching the next stop.
Below the main screen, the app displays the total distance covered, total distance left, and progress percentage. It also shows a progress bar indicating the journey's progress.
It uses a LinearProgressIndicator to show the progress visually.

Each stop in the list displays its name, distance, and progress status (completed, reached, or pending).

If the number of Stops > 10, then a lazy Column is used to display the stops, however when the number of stops is less than 10, then a regular Column is used to display it.

The app uses remember to manage the state of the unit (km or miles) and the index of the current stop.
When the "Switch" button is clicked, it toggles the unit between kilometers and miles.
When the "Next Stop Reached" button is clicked, it increments the currentStopIndex and resets it to 0 if it exceeds the number of stops.

To convert kilometers to miles, the distance in kilometers is multiplied by 0.621371.

The app calculates the total distance covered and left based on the current stop index.

Total distance covered is calculated by summing the distances of all stops before the current stop index.
Total distance left is calculated by summing the distances of all stops starting from the current stop index.

It also calculates the progress percentage based on the total distance covered and left.

Progress percentage is calculated as the ratio of total distance covered to the total distance of the journey (total distance covered + total distance left), multiplied by 100.
If the total distance of the journey is 0 (i.e., no stops), the progress percentage is set to 0 to avoid division by zero.
So the formula used is :-
progressPercentage = (totalDistanceCovered / (totalDistanceCovered + totalDistanceLeft)) * 100.
